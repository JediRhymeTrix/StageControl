# StageControl [WIP]
A lightweight macOS 13+ utility to toggle Stage Manager on a per-workspace level.


**NOTE:** Turns out, Apple does not expose any APIs to manage Mission Control. So, there's no direct way to keep track of the workspaces. All workarounds for this seem to be defunct on Ventura. Thus, as of now, this project has to be on the backburner for at least a while, until I can find an alternative.
